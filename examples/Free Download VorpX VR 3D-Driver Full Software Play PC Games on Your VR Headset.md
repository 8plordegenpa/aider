In December 2021, VorpX celebrated its 10th anniversary by releasing a free VR mod for Cyberpunk 2077, one of the most anticipated games of the year. The mod allows you to play Cyberpunk 2077 in VR with full head tracking and positional audio, as well as some other features like dynamic resolution scaling and FidelityFX upscaling. The mod is compatible with any VR headset that works with SteamVR[^1^]. To download the mod, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install Cyberpunk 2077 on your PC. You can buy it from Steam or GOG.
2. Download and install the latest version of VorpX from their website[^2^]. You don't need to purchase a license key to use the mod.
3. Run VorpX and select Cyberpunk 2077 from the game list. Make sure you enable DirectVR mode and FidelityFX upscaling for the best performance and image quality.
4. Run Cyberpunk 2077 and enjoy the game in VR!

Note that this mod is only for Cyberpunk 2077 and does not work with other games. If you want to play other games in VR with VorpX, you need to buy a license key from their website[^2^]. VorpX is constantly updated with new features and game profiles, so it is worth checking out if you are a fan of VR gaming.

If you are wondering how VorpX works and what features it offers, here is a brief overview. VorpX is a 3D driver that converts the image of a game to an output that is suitable for VR headsets. It does this by applying various techniques such as stereoscopic 3D, head tracking, lens distortion correction, positional audio and more. VorpX also has a feature called DirectVR, which provides VR compatibility for games with as little need for user interaction as possible. DirectVR can automatically adjust the game settings, such as field of view, resolution and mouse sensitivity, to match the VR headset. It can also enable native VR features in some games, such as VR menus and controllers.
 
VorpX has a large database of game profiles that are optimized for VR. You can browse the game list on their website or in the VorpX configuration app. You can also create your own profiles for games that are not supported by default. VorpX allows you to customize various aspects of the VR experience, such as 3D strength, image zoom, head tracking sensitivity and more. You can also use hotkeys to switch between different modes and settings while playing.
 
Besides games, VorpX also lets you watch videos and browse the web in VR. You can use the VorpX desktop viewer to access any application on your PC in a virtual screen. You can also watch videos with VLC and MPC-HC (including 360Â° videos) or use the VorpX cinema mode to watch movies in a virtual theater. VorpX supports various video formats and codecs, such as SBS, OU, Anaglyph and more.
